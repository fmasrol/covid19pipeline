Data pipeline using Jupyter Lab with a public Covid-19 REST API to obtain real-time pandemic statistics

# Final Exam: Programming Project - [Covid-19 Data Pipeline] Fazrul Masrol

In this final project, I used RapidAPI's Restful `Covid-19 API`: An API that allows users to fetch real-time and historical statistics on the pandemic. I obtained the API from https://rapidapi.com/hub 

Covid-19 Data Pipeline:

I utilized one of the endpoints to retrieve the `real-time` status of the pandemic which are updated every 15 minutes, allowing users to obtain real-time representation of the Covid-19 cases. The endpoint was used as a base, and further specified the statistics on countries in `North America`. 
Real-time data displayed:
- Active cases
- Critical cases
- Recovered cases
- Total cases

`Code Content:`
1. Covid-19 WebAPi
2. Updating & correcting data
3. Analyzing results
4. Plotting
5. Status code and CSV conversion
